                Enrolls Sat6 to IDM or AD and configures External Authentication using IDM or AD as the Auth source.
                Requires the same Sat6 and IDM or AD Server domain, to work out of the box.
                The Sat6 Server's first nameserver should be pointing to the IDM Server.
                One can use test-external-auth VM to test this feature quickly for IDM EXTERNAL_AUTH
                One can use the Windows AD VM itself to test this feature quickly for AD EXTERNAL_AUTH
                This will be useful for testing Kerberos/SSO, 2FA, e.t.c features with IDM or AD.
                Please note, this is not LDAP Authentication.

                The Sat6 Server's first nameserver should be pointing to the IDM Server.
